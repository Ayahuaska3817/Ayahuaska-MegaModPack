Two main issues with no solutions yet (if you have one, let me know):


The skills of the Ranger's pets and the Engineer's Mech are not visible.

(Pet health bar / F4 Swap pets / Attack my target / Return to me / Guard - Avoid Fight)


And the resource bar for the Revenant's Brill specialization does not have the arrows indicating the evolution of the resource generation as in the revenant resources video above(but we can still see where the resource is)
